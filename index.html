    <h1>The Republic of Astris</h1>
    <h3>History of the Republic of Astris</h3>
    <p>Year 1287: The revolution.
        The creation of Astris was when the Astirian Region of the Kikzulian Empire (Now known as Grasislo) revolted to form a Republic, it was supplied by the Krystis empire which had made considerable advancements.
        This was the first conflict that Kikzulian had to fight with new technology like cannons and advanced crossbows, so it struggled to hold off the Astirian Militias and eventually gave up. Border talks began and it was decided that Astiria now called the Republic of Astris, would receive considerable land in the west including the regions of Tholomu, Griosa, and Khrysin.
       
    </p> Year 1289: Political stability.
        The first election took place a month after the revolution ended where the war hero, Major Brin Loius ran for the leader of Astris. The lord, Millio Kridum also ran seeking power in the republic. Brin wanted to militarize while Millio wanted to create a trade empire. Eventually during the vote while Millio was making a speech in Polyios, a city in Griosa, a Griosa nationalist set off a cannon that was set up to fire after his speech and assassinated the lord as a message for other Griosais to revolt for their independence against the new and weak Astris. Brin quickly took leadership and began drafting villages to fight against a possible Grios revolution and as tensions rose Brin made a horrible decision and decided to use new highly reactive to fire, explosive dust on hundreds of Griosa villages which caused the Krystis Empire to attack them from the south while Kikzulian attacked from the east and north.
        
        <p>year 1290: The Griosa Liberation War. Kikzulia launched a fast assault, now better trained with cannon and a new more advanced kind of artillery called the Designated Striker Cannon or the DSC which they used to bombard any charges. Kystis advanced from the south with newly developed Bolter prototypes which had a balance in the back to tuck under your shoulder, crossbow mechanics in the middle with a faster reload using bolt action and smaller projectiles, and a small barrel at the front where the projectiles were fired from, which they used to destroy the Astrisian southern defenses along with the DSC they made themselves. Astris attempted to gain allies as they struggled to hold off the two giant empires crashing down on them and eventually one country contacted them. It was the country of Cyireia in the south offering them a vehicle called the metal elephant and the land crusher. The metal elephant was a infantry transport vehicle while the land crusher acted as a moving bunker with a faster kind of bolter called a wave breaker in the back, a DSC in the front able to be operated, armor on the side, and beds inside for the Land Crusher crew. They nearly were transported before Astris had to surrender and give up a bunch of land making them too small to be an imperial empire.

        </p>Year 1321: The elevation. Astris had been struck down to the smallest nation other than the dragon hook islands which were a territory in the south. The countrys civillians lived in poverty barely making by. No one wanted to lead this mess but eventually something happened. A leader rose into the election promising to make the country bigger non aggressively and the entire country rejoyced, voting for them immediately. When he was elected a top secret project called Expansion Elevation started and was worked on by engineers, mages, and scientists alike. In year 1323 the land began to break off from the ground floating into the air, and making the Republic of Astris go into the sky. Air waves came up allowing Astrians in and out and only Astrians.

<p> Renaissance, Year 1354: Astris lived in peace and quiet in the sky for years and years which allowed them to make loads of infrastructurural achievements like giant castles, huge libraries, and amazing interiors as they slowly reverted to a monarchy and traditional without advancements. This was detrimental because of something that would come soon.</p>

<p>Tension, Year 1511: As a revolution occured in the south of the continent on the mountaineum islands countries took sides, the countries involved with Astris were on two sides, the Phai alliance supporting the west with the countries Astris, Listol, and Infreli. Supporting the east was the Elik alliance with the countries Eshkelp, Gruslo, and Eritrea. Tensions kept rising as the two sides began showing more and more support for their supporting kingdom. </p>
